                    <p className="leading-relaxed">
                        At Al-Firdous Seattle, we support Muslim women of color in South Seattle and greater South King County by fostering identity and belonging. Through hikes, community service, workshops, and mental health retreats, we provide opportunities to build peer relationships, mentorship, and a strong support network.

                        We also collaborate with local organizations, including the Islamic Center of Tacoma, to host community events. In December 2024, we organized a Sistersâ€™ Retreat, offering a space for Muslim women to connect, reflect, and grow together.

                        Through these initiatives, we are committed to breaking barriers of isolation and creating a stronger, more connected community.
