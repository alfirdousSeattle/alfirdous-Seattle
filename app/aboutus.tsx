            Founded in 2024, Al-Firdous Seattle is dedicated to building a supportive and inclusive community 
            where individuals feel valued, connected, and empowered. We create meaningful opportunities for 
            engagement through outdoor experiences, workshops, mentorship, community service, and wellness retreats. 
            Our initiatives foster personal growth, mental well-being, and strong social connections while addressing 
            barriers like isolation and limited access to resources. By collaborating with local organizations, we 
            expand our impact and continue to strengthen community ties.
